Hollo changelog
===============

Version 0.8.0
-------------

To be released.

 -  Added support for separating worker nodes from the web server for better
    scalability in high-traffic scenarios.  This allows running web server and
    background workers (Fedify message queue and import worker) in separate
    processes, preventing heavy federation workloads from slowing down web
    server responsiveness.  This is particularly beneficial for instances with
    thousands of followers where a single post can generate thousands of
    outbox messages.  [[#350]]

     -  Added `NODE_TYPE` environment variable to control which components run
        in each process: `all` (default, current behavior), `web` (web server
        only), or `worker` (workers only).
     -  All nodes share the same PostgreSQL database, which acts as the message
        queue backend using `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY` for real-time message delivery.
     -  Added comprehensive documentation for Docker Compose, systemd, and
        manual deployment setups with worker separation.
     -  Added `pnpm worker` script for running worker-only nodes.

 -  Reduced idle memory usage by lazy-loading several heavy dependencies and
    startup-only code paths based on actual memory measurements.  This lowers
    the baseline footprint of `NODE_TYPE=all`, `web`, and `worker`
    deployments, especially on single-user instances with filesystem storage.
    [[#435]]

     -  Markdown formatting now loads Shiki only when rich text formatting is
        actually needed, instead of at server startup.
     -  Filesystem deployments no longer pull S3-specific storage code into the
        initial web server startup path.
     -  The web server and worker process now import each other's code paths
        only when the selected `NODE_TYPE` needs them.
     -  Preview card scraping, media processing, and authentication helpers now
        load on demand instead of eagerly during route registration.

 -  Added a production build step powered by `tsdown`, and changed
    `pnpm prod` and `pnpm worker` to run the compiled JavaScript output with
    Node.js instead of running TypeScript through `tsx`.  Docker images now
    build these JavaScript files in a builder stage and include them in the
    runtime image.  [[#357]]

 -  Moved remote replies scraping from synchronous post ingestion to a
    rate-limited background worker.  Remote posts now enqueue reply collection
    scraping jobs instead of fetching nested replies inline, which prevents
    slow or very large remote reply collections from delaying federation
    processing.  [[#445], [#447]]

     -  Added per-origin throttling and `429 Too Many Requests` backoff for
        remote replies scraping.
     -  Added bounded scraping controls:
        `REMOTE_REPLIES_SCRAPE_DEPTH`, `REMOTE_REPLIES_SCRAPE_MAX_ITEMS`,
        `REMOTE_REPLIES_SCRAPE_INTERVAL_SECONDS`,
        `REMOTE_REPLIES_SCRAPE_BACKOFF_SECONDS`, and
        `REMOTE_REPLIES_SCRAPE_COOLDOWN_SECONDS`.

 -  Added automatic refresh of stale remote actor profiles.  When receiving
    activities like `Announce` or `Create(Note)`, Hollo now checks if the
    actor's cached data is stale and asynchronously refreshes their profile
    in the background.  This helps keep remote actor information (avatars,
    display names, etc.) up to date without relying solely on `Update`
    activities from remote servers.  [[#348]]

     -  Added `REMOTE_ACTOR_STALENESS_DAYS` environment variable to configure
        how many days before a remote actor's data is considered stale.
        Defaults to `7` days.
     -  Added `REFRESH_ACTORS_ON_INTERACTION` environment variable.  When set
        to `true`, checks for stale actors on all activity types (likes, emoji
        reactions, follows, etc.).  When `false` (default), only checks on
        activities that appear in timelines (`Announce`, `Create`).

 -  Added Mastodon 4.5-compatible quote post APIs.  The `quote` field on
    Status entities now uses the Mastodon `Quote` entity format
    (`{ state, quoted_status }`) instead of the previous Fedibird-style flat
    status format.  The `quote_id` field is kept for backward compatibility.

     -  Added `quoted_status_id` parameter to `POST /api/v1/statuses` as the
        Mastodon 4.5 way to create quote posts (alongside existing `quote_id`).
     -  Added `quotes_count` field to Status entities.
     -  Added `quote_approval` field to Status entities indicating whether
        a post can be quoted.
     -  Added `GET /api/v1/statuses/:id/quotes` endpoint to list quotes
        of a post with cursor-based pagination.
     -  Added `POST /api/v1/statuses/:id/quotes/:quoting_status_id/revoke`
        endpoint to let users revoke quotes of their posts.
     -  The `quote_approval_policy` parameter is accepted but ignored
        (all public/unlisted posts are freely quotable).

 -  Added automatic cleanup of unreachable remote actors on permanent
    delivery failures.  When sending activities to followers' inboxes fails
    permanently, Hollo now cleans up the associated records to avoid
    retrying delivery to dead servers.

     -  On `404 Not Found`: removes follower relationships for the failed
        actor so that future activities are no longer delivered to them.
        The account record itself is preserved.
     -  On `410 Gone`: deletes the remote account entirely (along with
        associated follows, mentions, likes, etc. via cascade) since the
        actor is explicitly marked as permanently gone.

 -  Improved inbox handling for deleted remote actors using Fedify 2.1.0's
    unverified activity hooks.  Hollo now acknowledges unverifiable `Delete`
    activities with `202 Accepted` when the signing key fetch fails with
    `410 Gone`, preventing repeated delivery retries for actors that have
    already been permanently deleted.

 -  Optimized follower-only status visibility checks by preloading approved
    follow relationships and reusing simple `WHERE IN` conditions for status,
    conversation context, quote, and timeline queries.  [[#173], [#448]]

 -  Added `FEDIFY_DEBUG` environment variable to enable the [Fedify debugger],
    an embedded real-time dashboard for inspecting ActivityPub traces and
    activities.  When enabled, the debug dashboard is accessible at
    `/__debug__/`.  Intended for development use only.

 -  Added outbound activity ordering keys for stateful federation actions,
    using Fedify 2.0's ordered message delivery support.  This ensures
    remote servers process related actions in order, including post
    create/update/delete, reblog/unreblog, like/unlike,
    emoji reaction/unreaction, follow request lifecycle messages,
    block/unblock, and post updates triggered by replies and poll votes.

 -  Fixed remote account force refresh and actor refresh getting stuck when a
    canonical fediverse handle had moved to a new actor IRI while a stale
    remote account row still claimed the old handle.  Hollo now verifies the
    canonical handle owner via WebFinger, deletes the stale remote account and
    its dependent data, and then updates or inserts the current actor.  When
    the conflict cannot be verified safely, force refresh now shows an explicit
    canonical handle conflict error instead of failing with a raw database
    unique-constraint error.  [[#424]]

 -  Added profile-specific tagged post pages at `/:handle/tagged/:tag`, so
    users can browse only posts from a given profile that use a particular
    hashtag.  The Mastodon-compatible `GET /api/v1/accounts/:id/statuses`
    endpoint now also applies its existing `tagged` query parameter to filter
    account timelines by hashtag.  [[#420]]

 -  Added an account-level preference for whether content warnings should be
    expanded by default.  The setting is available in the dashboard account
    editor and is now returned from `GET /api/v1/preferences`, which helps
    clients like Phanpy honor each account's preferred CW behavior.  [[#425]]

 -  Fixed Mastodon API compatibility for clients such as the official Mastodon
    iOS app by returning empty arrays for unimplemented trends and suggestions
    endpoints instead of `404 Not Found` responses.  The suggestions endpoints
    still require an authenticated user token.  [[#421], [#427] by Vignesh]

 -  Added a new dashboard page for thumbnail cleanup at `/thumbnail_cleanup`.
    Thumbnails from remote posts that have not been bookmarked, liked, reacted
    to, shared nor quoted by a local account before a given cut-off data can
    be mass-deleted in order to lower storage demand. The original posts are
    not deleted, neither is the relationship to the original media nor the `alt`
    text.  [[#409], [#436] by aliceif]

 -  Upgraded Fedify to 2.1.10.

Version 0.7.13
--------------

Released on April 26, 2026.

 -  Fixed a Mastodon API compatibility regression where replies to local posts
    were stored as `status` notifications, causing clients to show generic
    “posted” titles instead of reply notifications.  Replies are now stored as
    `mention` notifications.  [[#380]]

[#380]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/hollo/issues/380


Version 0.7.12
--------------

Released on April 25, 2026.

 -  Fixed a federation bug where duplicate Announce activities from the same
    actor for the same post could fail with a database uniqueness error instead
    of being treated idempotently.  [[#443], [#444]]

Version 0.7.11
--------------

Released on April 21, 2026.

 -  Fixed a security vulnerability where a public profile's Atom feed could
    expose followers-only posts and direct messages.  The Atom feed now only
    serves public and unlisted posts.  [[#440]]

[#440]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/hollo/issues/440


Version 0.7.10
--------------

Released on April 8, 2026.

 -  Upgraded Fedify to 1.10.8 for performance improvements and interoperability
    fixes.


Version 0.7.9
-------------

Released on March 29, 2026.

 -  Reduced the risk of long-running PostgreSQL transactions during federation
    processing.  Federation inbox handlers and remote actor post imports no
    longer wrap remote post/account persistence in explicit transactions, which
    could otherwise stay open while fetching remote ActivityPub objects,
    preview cards, and media attachments.  This should reduce `INSERT waiting`
    pile-ups and improve resilience when remote servers are slow or
    unresponsive.  [[#411]]

 -  Fixed a bug where timeline markers hadn't allowed partial updates.
    [[#412] by Nicole Mikołajczyk]

 -  Fixed a Mastodon API compatibility bug where some serialized statuses had
    emitted `null` mention URLs or unsupported attachment types, which could
    break rendering in Moshidon custom lists.  Mention URLs now fall back to
    the account IRI, and unsupported media types are normalized to
    `unknown`.  [[#414]]

Version 0.7.8
-------------

Released on March 27, 2026.

 -  Upgraded Fedify to 1.10.5 for security reasons.  [[CVE-2026-34148]]

[CVE-2026-34148]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/security/advisories/GHSA-gm9m-gwc4-hwgp


Version 0.7.7
-------------

Released on March 13, 2026.

 -  Fixed video thumbnail generation failing for some MP4/MOV files by writing
    the video data to a temporary file instead of piping it via stdin (`pipe:0`),
    which does not support seeking.  [[#397], [#398] by NTSK]

[#398]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/hollo/pull/398


Version 0.7.6
-------------

Released on March 11, 2026.

 -  Fixed a federation interoperability bug where reactions (`Like` and
    `EmojiReact`) to remote posts could be ignored when the activity `object`
    used a remote IRI that did not match Hollo's local URI pattern.
    Inbox handlers now fall back to resolving posts by `posts.iri`, so remote
    self-reactions (e.g., Misskey users reacting to their own remote notes)
    are persisted and shown correctly in Mastodon-compatible clients.  [[#394]]

 -  Hardened inbox reaction processing to tolerate duplicate deliveries by
    making `Like`/`EmojiReact` inserts idempotent, preventing duplicate-key
    failures during federation retries.

 -  Upgraded Fedify to 1.10.4.

[#394]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/hollo/issues/394


Version 0.7.5
-------------

Released on March 3, 2026.

 -  Fixed a bug where posts from blocked accounts could still appear in
    timeline inboxes (`/api/v1/timelines/home` and list timelines) when
    `TIMELINE_INBOXES` was enabled.  Timeline filtering now consistently
    excludes blocked accounts, including shared posts and replies related
    to blocked accounts.


Version 0.7.4
-------------

Released on February 24, 2026.

 -  Fixed a federation interoperability bug where follow requests to some
    Bonfire instances could remain pending even after receiving `Accept` or
    `Reject` activities.  Inbox follow handlers now fall back to resolving the
    embedded `Follow` object (with `crossOrigin: "trust"`) and match by actor
    when the `object` ID does not match Hollo's stored follow IRI.  [[#373]]

 -  Fixed a bug where the local account's `followingCount` was not updated
    when an `Accept` activity was processed via the fallback path that resolves
    the embedded `Follow` object (Path B).  The handler was incorrectly passing
    the accepting actor's account ID to `updateAccountStats` instead of the
    local follower's account ID.  [[#374]]

[#373]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/hollo/issues/373
[#374]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/hollo/issues/374


Version 0.7.3
-------------

Released on February 23, 2026.

 -  Temporarily changed Fedify's `firstKnock` setting to
    `draft-cavage-http-signatures-12` for outbound inbox deliveries as a
    compatibility workaround for Bonfire's current signature handling.
    This is intended to be reverted to Fedify's default RFC 9421-first
    behavior after the Bonfire fix is released.
    [[bonfire-networks/activity_pub#8]]

[bonfire-networks/activity_pub#8]: https://github.com/bonfire-networks/activity_pub/issues/8


Version 0.7.2
-------------

Released on February 10, 2026.

 -  Fixed a security vulnerability where DMs and followers-only posts were
    exposed through the ActivityPub outbox endpoint without authorization.
    The outbox now only serves public and unlisted posts.  Any unauthenticated
    request to the outbox could previously retrieve all posts regardless of
    their visibility setting.  [[CVE-2026-25808]]


Version 0.7.1
-------------

Released on February 4, 2026.

 -  Fixed emoji reaction notifications not displaying emoji information in
    Mastodon-compatible clients. The `/api/v1/notifications` endpoint now
    includes top-level `emoji` and `emoji_url` fields for `emoji_reaction`
    notifications, compatible with Pleroma/Akkoma clients like Phanpy.
    [[#358]]

[#358]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/hollo/issues/358


Version 0.7.0
-------------

Released on January 24, 2026.

 -  Implemented advanced search query operators for the `/api/v2/search`
    endpoint, enabling Mastodon-compatible search filtering.  Supported
    operators include:

     -  `has:media` / `has:poll` — Filter by attachments
     -  `is:reply` / `is:sensitive` — Filter by post characteristics
     -  `language:xx` — Filter by ISO 639-1 language code
     -  `from:username` — Filter by author (supports `@user`, `user@domain`)
     -  `mentions:username` — Filter by mentioned user
     -  `before:YYYY-MM-DD` / `after:YYYY-MM-DD` — Filter by date range
     -  Negation with `-` prefix (e.g., `-has:media`)
     -  `OR` operator for alternative matches
     -  Parentheses for grouping (e.g., `(from:alice OR from:bob) has:poll`)

 -  Significantly improved `/api/v1/notifications` endpoint performance by
    implementing a materialized notifications system. The endpoint now uses
    dedicated `notifications` and `notification_groups` tables instead of
    generating notifications on-demand via complex SQL queries, resulting in
    approximately 24% improvement (2.5s → 1.9s). Key changes include:

     -  Added `notifications` table to store notification events as they occur
        during federation activities (follows, likes, mentions, shares, etc).
     -  Added `notification_groups` table for Mastodon-compatible notification
        grouping and aggregation metadata.
     -  Implemented automatic notification creation in federation inbox handlers
        for all notification types.
     -  Backfilled recent notifications (100 per type) during migration to
        prevent empty notification lists after upgrade.
     -  Poll expiry notifications are queried dynamically on-demand since they
        cannot be pre-generated without background job scheduling.

 -  Enabled gzip/deflate compression for all API responses, reducing response
    sizes by 70–92% and improving overall API performance. For example,
    `/api/v1/notifications` responses are now compressed from 767KB to 58KB,
    `/api/v1/timelines/home` from 91KB to 14KB, resulting in faster load times
    and reduced bandwidth usage.

 -  Implemented Mastodon v2 grouped notifications API (`/api/v2/notifications`),
    which provides server-side notification grouping to reduce client complexity
    and improve performance. The API groups notifications of types `favourite`,
    `follow`, `reblog`, `admin.sign_up`, and `emoji_reaction` together when they
    target the same post or account. New endpoints include:

     -  `GET /api/v2/notifications`: Get paginated grouped notifications with
        deduplicated accounts and statuses
     -  `GET /api/v2/notifications/:group_key`: Get a specific notification group
     -  `GET /api/v2/notifications/:group_key/accounts`: Get all accounts in a
        notification group
     -  `POST /api/v2/notifications/:group_key/dismiss`: Dismiss a notification
        group
     -  `GET /api/v2/notifications/unread_count`: Get unread notification count

 -  Fixed `POST /api/v1/statuses` and `PUT /api/v1/statuses/:id` endpoints
    rejecting FormData requests.  These endpoints now properly accept both
    JSON and FormData content types, improving compatibility with Mastodon
    clients that send `multipart/form-data` requests.
    [[#170], [#171] by Emelia Smith]

 -  Fixed a bug where multiple JSON objects were written on a single line
    in log files when `LOG_FILE` environment variable was set.  Upgraded
    LogTape to 2.0.0 and now uses `jsonLinesFormatter` to ensure proper
    JSON Lines format with one JSON object per line.  [[#174]]

 -  Fixed `POST /api/v1/statuses` endpoint rejecting requests with `null`
    values in optional fields. The endpoint now properly accepts `null`
    values for fields like `media_ids`, `poll`, `spoiler_text`,
    `in_reply_to_id`, and other optional parameters, improving
    compatibility with Mastodon clients.  [[#177], [#179] by Lee ByeongJun]

 -  Implemented asynchronous import job processing with a background worker
    to improve the reliability and performance of account data imports
    (following accounts, lists, muted/blocked accounts, bookmarks).
    Large imports no longer block the HTTP request, and users can see
    real-time progress of their imports.  [[#94], [#295] by Juyoung Jung]

 -  Improved instance API responses for better third-party client compatibility.
    [[#296] by Juyoung Jung]

     -  `GET /api/v1/instance`: Added `configuration.accounts.max_featured_tags`
        field, `thumbnail` field with Hollo logo, and implemented actual `stats`
        values (`user_count`, `status_count`, `domain_count`) from the database.
     -  `GET /api/v2/instance`: Added `thumbnail` object with `url`, `blurhash`,
        and `versions` fields, `icon` array, and updated `max_featured_tags` and
        `max_pinned_statuses` values from 0 to 10.

 -  Fixed OAuth token endpoint rejecting requests from clients that send
    credentials via both HTTP Basic authentication and request body
    simultaneously.  The endpoint now accepts such requests if the credentials
    are identical, improving compatibility with clients like tooot.
    [[#296] by Juyoung Jung]

 -  Upgraded Fedify to 1.10.0.

 -  Added `prev` link to the `Link` header in `/api/v1/notifications` API
    responses for Mastodon-compatible pagination.  This allows clients to
    efficiently fetch new notifications since the last received notification,
    improving caching capabilities and reducing server load.  [[#312]]

 -  Fixed OAuth token endpoint failing to parse request body when HTTP clients
    don't send `Content-Type` header.  Some clients like Lobsters' Sponge
    HTTP client don't set `Content-Type` for POST requests with form data,
    causing authentication failures.  The endpoint now correctly parses
    URL-encoded form data even when `Content-Type` is missing or set to
    `text/plain`.

 -  Implemented Mastodon 4.5.0 quote notification types (`quote` and
     `quoted_update`) for improved quote post interaction tracking.
     Users now receive notifications when their posts are quoted by others
     and when posts they've quoted are edited by the original authors.
     Key features include:

      -  Added `quote` notification type that triggers when someone quotes
         your post, with the notification showing the quote post itself.
      -  Added `quoted_update` notification type that triggers when a post
         you quoted is edited, with the notification showing your quote post
         to provide context.
      -  Both notification types are non-groupable, meaning each quote or edit
         generates an individual notification for better visibility.
      -  Self-quotes (quoting your own posts) do not generate notifications
         to avoid unnecessary noise.
      -  Existing quote posts are automatically backfilled with notifications
         during migration to ensure consistent notification history.
      -  Added database index on `posts.quote_target_id` for improved query
         performance when looking up quote relationships.

 -  Removed dependency on deprecated *fluent-ffmpeg* package and now invoke
    ffmpeg binary directly for video screenshot generation.  This change
    improves reliability by preventing request failures when video screenshot
    generation encounters errors.  On failure, a default screenshot (Hollo
    logo) is now returned instead of aborting the entire upload request, and
    ffmpeg error output is logged for debugging.  [[#333] by Peter Jeschke]

 -  Fixed a bug where querying the `/api/v1/notifications` and
    `/api/v2/notifications` endpoints with unknown notification types
    (e.g., `types[]=reaction` from clients like Moshidon) resulted in
    `500 Internal Server Error` responses due to database enum validation
    failures.  The endpoints now filter out unknown notification types before
    passing them to the database layer, returning an empty result instead of
    an error.  [[#334] by Peter Jeschke]

 -  Fixed a bug where the `/api/v2/search` endpoint did not properly enforce
    the `limit` parameter on search results.  The endpoint now correctly
    limits the number of returned accounts and statuses to the requested
    limit (default 20, maximum 40), improving Mastodon API compatibility
    and preventing potential performance issues with large result sets.
    [[#210]]

 -  Significantly improved `/api/v2/search` endpoint performance when searching
    by URL or handle.  The endpoint now responds in approximately 1.4 seconds
    for URL searches, down from 8–10 seconds previously (approximately 85%
    improvement).  Key optimizations include:

     -  Skip unnecessary `lookupObject` calls for non-URL/non-handle queries,
        reducing remote federation lookups by 2–3 seconds.
     -  Skip full-text search on `posts.content_html` column when the query
        is a URL and the post is found in cache lookup (by IRI or URL),
        eliminating expensive table scans that took ~8 seconds.
     -  Added shared `HANDLE_PATTERN` regex in *src/patterns.ts* for
        consistent WebFinger handle validation across v1 and v2 APIs.

Version 0.6.20
--------------

Released on February 10, 2026.

 -  Fixed a security vulnerability where DMs and followers-only posts were
    exposed through the ActivityPub outbox endpoint without authorization.
    The outbox now only serves public and unlisted posts.  Any unauthenticated
    request to the outbox could previously retrieve all posts regardless of
    their visibility setting.  [[CVE-2026-25808]]

[CVE-2026-25808]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/hollo/security/advisories/GHSA-6r2w-3pcj-v4v5


Version 0.6.19
--------------

Released on December 20, 2025.

 -  Upgraded Fedify to 1.6.15 to fix a ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of
    Service) vulnerability in Fedify's HTML parsing code.  An attacker could
    exploit this vulnerability to cause denial of service by sending malicious
    HTML responses during federation operations.  [[CVE-2025-68475]]

[CVE-2025-68475]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/fedify/security/advisories/GHSA-rchf-xwx2-hm93


Version 0.6.18
--------------

Released on November 15, 2025.

 -  Reverted the `/api/v1/notifications` endpoint query optimization from 0.6.17
    due to a regression that caused server errors when serializing reactions
    without account information. The optimization attempted to reduce query
    complexity by separating post data loading, but inadvertently broke reaction
    serialization for nested posts (shares and quotes). Database indexes added
    in 0.6.17 are retained.


Version 0.6.17
--------------

Released on November 15, 2025.

 -  Significantly improved `/api/v1/notifications` endpoint performance by
    optimizing database queries and restructuring data loading strategy.
    The endpoint now responds in under 1.6 seconds, down from over 2.5 seconds
    previously (approximately 40% improvement). Key optimizations include:

     -  Pre-fetching muted and blocked account IDs to eliminate correlated
        subqueries in notification type queries.
     -  Separating post data loading into multiple targeted queries instead of
        using deeply nested lateral joins, reducing query complexity and
        execution time.
     -  Adding strategic database indexes on `follows`, `mutes`, `likes`, and
        `reactions` tables to improve query performance.


Version 0.6.16
--------------

Released on November 12, 2025.

 -  Fixed search functionality not returning any results when searching for
    post content.

 -  Fixed search results including shared posts (reposts/reblogs). Search now
    shows only original posts and replies, excluding shares.


Version 0.6.15
--------------

Released on November 7, 2025.

 -  Significantly improved `/nodeinfo/2.1` endpoint performance by optimizing
    database queries and adding appropriate indexes. The endpoint now responds
    in under 1 second even with millions of federated posts, down from 5–15
    seconds previously. This prevents load balancer health check failures and
    external service timeouts.  [[#282]]

[#282]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/hollo/issues/282


Version 0.6.14
--------------

Released on October 7, 2025.

 -  Fixed a critical security vulnerability where direct messages (DMs) were
    visible to all authenticated users regardless of whether they were
    participants in the conversation. The visibility filter now correctly
    restricts direct messages to only the sender and mentioned recipients,
    preventing unauthorized access to private conversations.

[#247]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/hollo/issues/247
[#255]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/hollo/pull/255


Version 0.6.13
--------------

Released on October 7, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where replies from followers who are not followed back were not
    visible in conversation threads. The visibility filter now correctly
    includes posts that mention the authenticated user, ensuring that all
    replies directed to the user are displayed regardless of follow-back status.


Version 0.6.12
--------------

Released on October 4, 2025.

 -  Fixed a critical security vulnerability where direct messages were leaked
    on public post pages. The replies list below posts now correctly filters
    to show only public or unlisted replies, preventing private conversations
    from being exposed.  [[#246], [#248] by Hyeonseo Kim]

[#248]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/hollo/pull/248


Version 0.6.11
--------------

Released on September 17, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where `Like` activities from Bluesky via BridgyFed were not
    being received due to invalid AT Protocol URIs.  This was resolved by
    upgrading Fedify to 1.5.9, which includes improved AT Protocol URI
    handling to properly parse URIs with DID authorities.  [[#217]]

[#217]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/hollo/issues/217


Version 0.6.10
--------------

Released on August 26, 2025.

 -  Upgraded Fedifyh to 1.5.7 which fixes a bug where HTTP Signature
    verification failed for requests having `created` or `expires` fields
    in their `Signature` header, causing `500 Internal Server Error` responses
    in inbox handlers.


Version 0.6.9
-------------

Released on August 25, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where ActivityPub Discovery failed to recognize XHTML
    self-closing `<link>` tags. The HTML/XHTML parser now correctly handles
    whitespace before the self-closing slash (`/>`), improving compatibility
    with XHTML documents that follow the self-closing tag format.

 -  Upgraded Fedify to 1.5.6.


Version 0.6.8
-------------

Released on August 21, 2025.

 -  Fixed a critical bug introduced in 0.6.7 where the search query would return
    too many results, causing out-of-memory errors and query timeouts.  The issue
    was caused by incorrect logical operator precedence when filtering
    future-dated posts.  [[#207], [#208] by aliceif]

[#207]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/hollo/issues/207
[#208]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/hollo/pull/208


Version 0.6.7
-------------

Released on August 19, 2025.

 -  Fixed timeline pollution caused by future-dated posts from malicious or
    misconfigured remote instances.  Posts with timestamps more than 5 minutes
    in the future are now filtered from all timeline endpoints while preserving
    them in the database for future display.  [[#199], [#201] by Hyeonseo Kim]

[#201]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/hollo/pull/201


Version 0.6.6
-------------

Released on August 8, 2025.

 -  Upgrade Fedify to 1.5.5, which includes a critical security
    fix [CVE-2025-54888] that addresses an authentication bypass
    vulnerability allowing actor impersonation.  [[CVE-2025-54888]]


Version 0.6.5
-------------

Released on July 17, 2025.

 -  Fixed an HTML injection vulnerability where form elements, scripts, and
    other potentially dangerous HTML tags in federated posts were not properly
    sanitized before rendering.  This could allow malicious actors to inject
    forms for phishing, execute JavaScript, or perform CSRF attacks.
    The fix implements strict HTML sanitization using an allowlist approach
    to ensure only safe HTML elements and attributes are rendered.
    [[CVE-2025-53941]]

[CVE-2025-53941]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/hollo/security/advisories/GHSA-w7gc-g3x7-hq8h


Version 0.6.4
-------------

Released on July 7, 2025.

 -  Fixed a regression bug where follower-only posts were returning `404 Not
    Found` errors when accessed through conversation threads. This was caused
    by improper OAuth scope checking that only accepted `read:statuses` scope
    but tokens contain `read` scope:  [[#169], [#172]]

     -  `GET /api/v1/statuses/:id`
     -  `GET /api/v1/statuses/:id/context`

[#169]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/hollo/issues/169
[#172]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/hollo/pull/172


Version 0.6.3
-------------

Released on June 23, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where remote posts mentioning the same user multiple times
    could not be retrieved due to database constraint violations.


Version 0.6.2
-------------

Released on June 8, 2025.

 -  Fixed an issue where Hollo 0.6.x installations upgraded from Hollo 0.5.x
    or earlier failed to sign in with Elk, a popular Mastodon client.
    This was caused by old application registrations incorrectly defaulting
    to non-confidential.  All existing applications are now properly set as
    confidential clients.  [[#167], [#168] by Emelia Smith]

[#167]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/hollo/issues/167
[#168]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/hollo/pull/168


Version 0.6.1
-------------

Released on June 5, 2025.

 -  Fixed `POST /oauth/token` endpoint rejecting requests with additional
    parameters not required by RFC 6749 but commonly sent by clients.
    The endpoint now gracefully ignores extra parameters like `scope` in
    `authorization_code` requests and `redirect_uri` in `client_credentials`
    requests instead of returning validation errors.

[#163]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/hollo/issues/163
[#164]: https://github.com/fedify-dev/hollo/pull/164


Version 0.6.0
-------------

Released on June 5, 2025.

 -  Revamped the environment variables for asset storage configuration.
    [[#115], [#121] by Emelia Smith]

     -  Added `FS_STORAGE_PATH` environment variable, which is required where
        `DRIVE_DISK` is set to `fs`.
     -  Added `STORAGE_URL_BASE` environment variable, which is required.
     -  Deprecated `FS_ASSET_PATH` in favor of `FS_STORAGE_PATH`.
     -  Deprecated `ASSET_URL_BASE` in favor of `STORAGE_URL_BASE`.

 -  Implemented OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow with support for access grants.
    This improves the security of the OAuth authorization process by separating
    the authorization code from the access token issuance.
    [[#130] by Emelia Smith]

 -  Hollo now requires the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable to be at least 44
    characters long.  This change ensures sufficient entropy for cryptographic
    operations.  [[#126] by Emelia Smith]

 -  Hollo now lets */.well-known/* and */oauth/* endpoints allow cross origin
    requests which is aligned with those of Mastodon.  [[#126] by Emelia Smith]

 -  Added the `BIND` environment variable to specify the host address to
    listen on.  [[#114], [#120] by Emelia Smith]

 -  The theme color of the profile page is now customizable.  The list of all
    available theme colors can be found in the [*Colors* section] of the Pico
    CSS docs.

 -  You can now sign out from the administration dashboard.
    [[#50], [#122] by Emelia Smith]

 -  On profile page, shared posts are now more visually separated from the
    original posts, and the time of sharing is now shown.  [[#111]]

 -  On profile page, alt texts for images are now expanded within `<details>`.
    [[#99], [#110] by Okuto Oyama]

 -  The `scope` parameter is now optional for `POST /oauth/token` endpoint.

 -  The current version string is displayed at the bottom of the dashboard page.
    [[#136], [#137] by RangHo Lee]

 -  Increased the maximum character limit for posts from 4,096 to 10,000
    characters.

 -  EXIF metadata of attached images are now stripped before storing them
    to prevent privacy leaks.  [[#152] by NTSK]

 -  Code blocks inside Markdown are now highlighted.  The syntax highlighting is
    powered By [Shiki].  See also the [complete list of supported languages].
    [[#149]]

 -  Implemented OAuth 2.0 Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) support with the
    `S256` code challenge method.  This enhances security by preventing
    authorization code interception attacks in the OAuth authorization flow.
    [[#155] by Emelia Smith]

 -  Added support for the `profile` OAuth scope for enhanced user authentication.
    This allows applications to request limited profile information using the
    new `/oauth/userinfo` endpoint and enables the `profile` scope to be used
    with the `GET /api/v1/accounts/verify_credentials` endpoint.
    [[#45], [#156] by Emelia Smith]

 -  Made few Mastodon API endpoints publicly accessible without
    authentication so that they behave more similarly to Mastodon:

     -  `GET /api/v1/statuses/:id`
     -  `GET /api/v1/statuses/:id/context`

 -  Upgraded Fedify to 1.5.3 and *@fedify/postgres* to 0.3.0.

 -  The minimum required version of Node.js is now 24.0.0.

 -  Fixed a bug where private replies were incorrectly delivered to all
    recipients of the original post, regardless of visibility settings.

 -  Improved privacy for direct messages by preventing delivery through
    shared inboxes.


Version 0.5.4
-------------

Released on February 26, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where custom emojis in the display name and bio had not been
    rendered correctly from other software including Mitra.

 -  Upgrade Fedify to 1.4.4.


Version 0.5.3
-------------

Released on February 22, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where when an account profile had been updated, the `Update`
    activity had been made with no `assertionMethods` field, which had caused
    interoperability issues with Mitra.

 -  Upgrade Fedify to 1.4.3.


Version 0.5.2
-------------

Released on February 20, 2025.

-  Fixed a bug where the `follows.follower_id` column had not referenced the
    `accounts.id` column.  [[#112]]

 -  Fixed a bug where `GET /api/v1/notifications` had returned server errors
    with some filters.  [[#113]]

 -  Fixed a bug where the federation dashboard had not shown due to server
    errors when an instance had just been set up.

 -  Upgrade Fedify to 1.4.2.


Version 0.5.1
-------------

Released on February 14, 2025.

 -  Fixed a bug where `GET /api/v1/accounts/:id/statuses` had tried to fetch
    remote posts for local accounts.  [[#107]]


Version 0.5.0
-------------

Released on February 12, 2025.

 -  The number of shares and likes became more accurate.

     -  The `Note` objects now have `shares` and `likes` collections with
        their `totalItems` numbers.
     -  When a remote `Note` is persisted, now the `totalItems` numbers of
        `shares` and `likes` are also persisted.
     -  When a `Announce(Note)` or `Undo(Announce(Note))` activity is received,
        now it is forwarded to the followers as well if the activity is signed.

 -  Added [`GET /api/v1/mutes`] API to Mastodon comapatiblity layer.  This API
    returns a list of accounts that are muted by the authenticated user.
    [[#103]]

 -  Added [`GET /api/v1/blocks`] API to Mastodon comapatiblity layer.  This API
    returns a list of accounts that are blocked by the authenticated user.
    [[#103]]

 -  On profile page, backward pagination (newer posts) is now available.
    [[#104], [#105] by Okuto Oyama]

 -  On profile page, images are no more captioned using `<figcaption>` but
    use only `alt` attribute for accessibility.  [[#99], [#100] by Okuto Oyama]

 -  Fixed a style bug where horizontal scrolling occurred when the screen
    size was reduced when there were many custom fields on profile page.
    [[#106] by Okuto Oyama]

 -  Added `ALLOW_HTML` environment variable to allow raw HTML inside Markdown.
    This is useful for allowing users to use broader formatting options outside
    of Markdown, but to avoid XSS attacks, it is still limited to a subset of
    HTML tags and attributes.

 -  On profile page, the favicon is now switched between light and dark mode
    according to the user's preference.  [[#101]]

 -  The `S3_REGION` environment variable became required if `DRIVE_DISK` is set
    to `s3`.  [[#95]]

 -  Upgrade Fedify to 1.3.3.

 -  Fixed an interoperability issue with GoToSocial.


Version 0.4.0
-------------

Released on December 30, 2024.

 -  Hollo is now powered by Node.js 23+ instead of Bun for more efficient
    memory usage.

 -  Added an experimental feature flag `TIMELINE_INBOXES` to store all posts
    visible to your timeline in the database, rather than filtering them
    in real-time as they are displayed.  This is useful for relatively
    larger instances with many incoming posts, but as of now it may have
    several bugs.  It is expected to be the default behavior in the future
    after it is stabilized.

 -  Now you can import and export your data from the administration dashboard
    in CSV format: follows, lists, accounts you muted, accounts you blocked,
    and bookmarks.

 -  You can now make your profile [`discoverable`].

 -  The profile page now shows a user's cover image if they have one.

 -  Added `GET /api/v1/statuses/:id/reblogged_by` API to Mastodon comapatiblity
    layer.  This API returns a list of accounts that have shared a post.

 -  Fixed a bug where a server error occurred when an invalid UUID was input via
    URL or form data.  [[#65]]

 -  Fixed a bug where the same post could be shared multiple times by the same
    account.

 -  Added `LOG_FILE` environment variable to specify the file path to write
    structured logs.  The logs are written in JSON Lines format.

 -  Improved the performance of recipients gathering during sending activities.

 -  For the sake of concision, now log sink for Sentry is removed.
